# Migration Status: React → Next.js

## ✅ Completed Setup

### Infrastructure
- [x] Next.js app created in `web/nextjs/`
- [x] TypeScript configuration
- [x] Tailwind CSS setup
- [x] Port configuration (React: 3000, Next.js: 3005)
- [x] Concurrent development scripts
- [x] Shared dependencies management

### Core Configuration
- [x] Sanity client setup (`src/lib/sanity.ts`)
- [x] TypeScript types for Sanity data
- [x] Basic routing structure (App Router)
- [x] GROQ queries organized (`src/lib/queries.ts`)
- [x] Basic components (LoadingSpinner)

### Pages Created
- [x] Homepage (`/`) - Migration status dashboard
- [x] About page (`/about`) - ✅ **FULLY MIGRATED**
- [x] Issues page (`/issues`) - Placeholder for future migration

## 🚀 Ready to Test

You can now run both apps simultaneously:

```bash
# From the web directory
npm run dev:both
```

This will start:
- **React app**: http://localhost:3000 (existing site)
- **Next.js app**: http://localhost:3005 (migration in progress)

## 📋 Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Phase 1: Simple Static Pages (Week 1)
1. ✅ **About page** - **COMPLETED** (fully migrated with content and styling)
2. **Migrate Contact page** - Simple form page
3. **Migrate Masthead page** - Static content
4. **Migrate Advertise page** - Static content

### Phase 2: Basic Dynamic Pages (Week 2)
1. **Migrate IssuesList page** - Fetch from Sanity
2. **Migrate Issue page** - Dynamic routing with `[issueSlug]`
3. **Set up shared components** (Sidebar, Footer)

### Phase 3: Complex Pages (Week 3-4)
1. **Migrate ContentItem page** - Most complex, with rich content
2. **Migrate Author page** - Dynamic routing with `[authorSlug]`
3. **Migrate Section page** - Dynamic routing with `[sectionSlug]`

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 5-6)
1. **Search functionality** - API routes
2. **Form handling** - Submit, Subscribe, Contact forms
3. **Image optimization** - Next.js Image component
4. **SEO optimization** - Meta tags, structured data

## 🔧 Technical Decisions Made

### Styling Strategy
- **Current**: Tailwind CSS (for simplicity)
- **Future**: Can migrate Theme UI later if needed
- **Rationale**: Faster initial migration, can optimize styling later

### Data Fetching
- **Strategy**: Server-side rendering with Next.js App Router
- **Benefits**: Better SEO, faster initial page loads
- **Implementation**: Async server components

### Component Migration
- **Approach**: Gradual migration, component by component
- **Strategy**: Start with simple components, work up to complex ones
- **Reusability**: Shared components between React and Next.js where possible

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Performance
- [ ] Faster initial page loads
- [ ] Better Core Web Vitals scores
- [ ] Improved SEO rankings

### Developer Experience
- [ ] TypeScript support
- [ ] Better error handling
- [ ] Improved build times

### User Experience
- [ ] Maintained functionality
- [ ] Improved accessibility
- [ ] Better mobile performance

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Rollback Strategy
- Keep React app running during entire migration
- Can switch back to React app if issues arise
- Gradual migration allows for easy debugging

### Testing Strategy
- Test each migrated page thoroughly
- Compare functionality between React and Next.js versions
- Use both apps simultaneously for validation

## 📝 Notes

- Both apps can run simultaneously without conflicts
- Sanity client configuration is identical between apps
- TypeScript types ensure data consistency
- Next.js app is ready for Vercel deployment
- Migration can be paused/resumed at any time

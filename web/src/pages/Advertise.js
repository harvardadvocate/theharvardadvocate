            <i>Advertise with the oldest publication at Harvard University.</i>
            <br />
            <br />
            The Harvard Advocate is Harvard's oldest publication. Literary
            luminaries like T.S. Eliot, Wallace Stevens, e.e. cummings, Conrad
            Aiken, John Ashbery, James Agee, and many more were first published
            in The Advocate. Our issues are mailed worldwide to our subscriber
            and alumni network, along with distribution to every dorm room,
            academic reception, and library at Harvard, bringing our readership
            to over 10,000.
            <br />
            <br />
            In our issues, we print on high quality paper with heavy stock
            binding, ensuring the magazine's longevity. The Advocate remains a
            centerpiece on coffee tables for months. We advertise online, where
            our website receives thousands of monthly visits.
            <br />
